Welcome! I am currently working as an Applied Scientist at <a href="https://engineering.zalando.com/"> <b>Zalando SE</b></a> in Berlin. My job entails solving interesting challenges in the e-commerce space, specifically related to <a href="https://research.zalando.com/"> Fashion Artificial Intelligence </a>. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> 
Before moving to Germany, I spent 2 years as a Machine Learning Researcher at the Montreal Lab of <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/en/"><b>Borealis AI</b></a>. I completed my graduate studies from the department of Management Sciences at the University of Waterloo, Canada. During masters, my research focused on the applications of deep learning to natural language processing. My thesis was on the topic <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09012.pdf">Natural Language Generation with Neural Variational Models</a>. My research supervisor at the <b>University of Waterloo</b> was Prof. <a href="http://ov-research.uwaterloo.ca/index.html">Olga Vechtomova</a> and I have also worked closely with Dr. <a href="https://lili-mou.github.io"> Lili Mou</a>. </p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">I am an alumnus of the <b>Indian Institute of Technology Madras</b> (IITM), having graduated in 2015 with a dual degree in Transportation Engineering. For my thesis at IITM, I explored the applications of machine learning on traffic data and travel time prediction.</p>
